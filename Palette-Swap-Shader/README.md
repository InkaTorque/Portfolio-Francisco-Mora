  - **Palette Swap Shader** : Showcases a palette swap tool . Given a a texture of 2 pixels high , containing the original color palette on the bottom row and the new palette on the top row , the shader swaps all the colors found on the original palette with the new colors indicated by the artists. This shader works on both pixel art and non pixel art sprites.
