## HOW DOES IT WORK?
1. The Combat Designers are able to select which player mode they want to create or edit for the opened fight sequence (1P, 2P , 3P, 4P)

2. The Combat Designers also have the option to clone a player mode into another , making it easier to modify the fights according to the number of players.

3. Once the Combat Designers enter Combat Mode, they will be able to select from a dropdown menu the type of enemy that they want to insert into the fight sequence.

4. Once the enemy type has been selected, the combat designer just select the position where the enemy has to appear by clicking on the battle area (the gray rectangle in the top of the screen with the red and blue guides).

4. The Combat Designers can also select how much time (in secods) the created enemy takes to show up on screen since the begining of the fight sequence.

5. If the Fight Sequence is composed of multiple waves of enemies , the Combat Designers can add as many sub-sequences as they want and they can also set the triggering conditions for each of those sub-sequences. The two options are:
    - Global Kill Count : This sub-sequence appears once the players have defeated N amount of total enemies.
    - Parent Death Trigger : This sub-sequence appears once an specific enemy from a previous sequence has been killed.

6. Once the Combat Designer has finished, the Fight Sequence gets saved into a json file.
