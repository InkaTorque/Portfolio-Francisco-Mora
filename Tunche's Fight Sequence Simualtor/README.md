## HOW DOES IT WORK?
1. The Combat Designers load up an specific Fight Sequence and select which of the four player configurations they want to test out.

2. Once the "START SIMULATION" button is selected, the simulator will start spawning the enemies defined in the fight sequence according to their position and appear delay times.

3. Combat Designers can kill enemies by clicking on them , triggering the creation of sub-sequence if the Fight Sequence has them set up.

4. This tool is used to test fight sequence enemy flow without having to load up the game and play each fight sequence by hand.
